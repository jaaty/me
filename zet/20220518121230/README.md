# Types of Access Control

RBAC - Role Based Access Control

* access control mechanism based on role-permissions

ABAC - Attribute Based Access Control

* more fine-grained than RBAC, as it doesn't rely on roles with a grouped set of permissions
* has the concepts of attributes and policies, which together combine to determine a user's permissions

ACL - Access Control List

* associates permissions with a system resource, not the user
* the list of permissions for the resource specify which users have what level of access to the resource (e.g., Bob can read only, Alice can read and write)
